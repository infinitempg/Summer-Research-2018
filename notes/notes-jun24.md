# Week of June 24 Notes

Tasks:

* Plot spectra for all points
* Analyze the NII line if possible
  * 2005_ip
  * 2007K
* ~~`101107_IIn`:~~
  * ~~`SN_2010jl`: Set linear scale, high of 250.~~
* Plot all offsets?
* Redo SN_2005ip_01_R 480
* Redo SN_2008en_02_R 345

## `SN_2010jl`

Very close!

## NII Lines

Seems like the NII line from the galaxy is drowned out by the SN.

### `SN2007K`

These two look fairly similar, if anything the different range may have stretched the H Alpha line.

### `SN_2005ip`

The comparisons for `SN_2005ip` aren't exactly fair since I did them for different aperture ranges - but it does show that the trend *could* be different.
