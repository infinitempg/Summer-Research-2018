# Week of June 24 Notes

Tasks:

* ~~Plot spectra for all points~~
* ~~Analyze the NII line if possible~~
  * ~~2005_ip~~
  * ~~2007K~~
* ~~`101107_IIn`:~~
  * ~~`SN_2010jl`: Set linear scale, high of 250.~~
* Plot all offsets?
* Redo `SN_2005ip_01_R 480`
* Redo `SN_2008en_02_R 345`

## Plotting for all points

This didn't really prove very fruitful but I think that comes down to me not really knowing the best way to visualize it. I tried plotting them all on to one plot but that wasn't super helpful:

![](/SN_Images/SN2007K/SN2007K_galspec.png)

Individual plots are in the `/SN_Images/SN2007K/Gal_spec` folder.

There were some that I still have to redo (`SN_2005ip_01_R 480` and `SN_2008en_02_R 345` due to accidentally forgetting to delete the other aperture).

## `SN_2010jl`

Very close!

## NII Lines

Seems like the NII line from the galaxy is drowned out by the SN.

### `SN2007K`

![](/SN_Images/SN2007K_NII/SN2007K_poly.png)

These two look fairly similar, if anything the different range may have stretched the H Alpha line.

### `SN_2005ip`
![](/SN_Images/SN_2005ip_NII/SN_2005ip_01.png)
![](/SN_Images/SN_2005ip_NII/SN_2005ip_01_poly.png)
![](/SN_Images/SN_2005ip_NII/SN_2005ip_02.png)
![](/SN_Images/SN_2005ip_NII/SN_2005ip_02_poly.png)

The comparisons for `SN_2005ip` aren't exactly fair since I did them for different aperture ranges - but it does show that the trend *could* be different. I think this will need further work.
