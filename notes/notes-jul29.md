# Week of July 29 Notes

**NOTE: Older notes need to be converted from `SN_Images` to `SN_Images_old`

## 7/29

Completed [table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IgvpZEnnAsGajjNLueQ3enldJwznrTXmheWFyKa-cqk/edit?usp=sharing) of *all* objects in the `DEIMOS` folder.

Found that there were several objects which were SN, but *not* Type IIn. Also found that some of the ones with directory labels IIn were not listed as that ([Transient Name Server](https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/))

## 7/30

Going to re-do as many graphs as possible. Some that were previously not completed are actually workable (didn't look at the scales well enough). Progress can be tracked under the `Re-graph` column in the table.

## 8/1

Okay all of the ones that I could "easily" do are finished. There are a few that are a bit difficult to do (unclear which is the continuum or the H-Alpha line is really short) that I skipped over.
